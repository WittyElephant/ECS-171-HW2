# ECS-171-HW2

Neural netork project completed in my machine learning class. Pertaining to the DeepLeanToolbox folder, although I healily modified them I did not originally write them.
That honor goes to person who created https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox and I used them under the GNU/GNL open liscence.
